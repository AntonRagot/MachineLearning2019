# Machine Learning Project 1: Higgs boson
_by Robin Zbinden, Anton Ragot, Peter Krcmar (Team RAP)_


The goal of this project is to detect an Higgs Boson given some observed data.

## Usage

1. Download the train.csv and test.csv sets from [here](https://github.com/epfml/ML_course/tree/master/projects/project1/data)
2. Place them in the `data` directory
3. Run the script `run.py` located in the `code` directory with:
```
python run.py
```
4. The generated predictions are saved to `output/predictions.csv`

## File structure

Here is a brief overview of our project's structure. More detailed explanations for each file are provided in the next section.

## Detailed file description

`constants.py` defines some constants (e.g. our K for k-fold cross-validation)

`utils.py` defines useful functions like loading data from a csv file

`preprocessing.py` defines functions used for preprocessing data

`implementations.py` contains the required regression functions

`features.py` defines functions used for feature expansion

`train.py` defines functions used for training our model

`prediction.py` defines functions used for predicting labels and measuring accuracy

`generate_model.py` is a script that generates our model from scratch. It produces the following files: `medians.np`, `weights.npy`, `degrees.npy`
**Note that the model was pre-generated. Only re-run this script if you deleted any of the generated files as it takes some time to run.**

`run.py` is a script that uses the files generated by `generate_model.py` and produces the predictions for the testing data. This is stored in the `predictions.csv` file

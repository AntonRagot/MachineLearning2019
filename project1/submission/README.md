# Machine Learning Project 1: Higgs boson
_by Robin Zbinden, Anton Ragot, Peter Krcmar (Team RAP)_

The goal of this project is to detect an Higgs Boson given some observed data

## Usage

1. Download the train.csv and test.csv sets from the following link : https://github.com/epfml/ML_course/tree/master/projects/project1/data
2. Place them in data/
3. Run the script
```
python run.py
```
4. You can find our predictions in the file located in output/predictions.csv

## File structure

## Detailed file description

**constants.py** defines some constants (e.g. our K for k-fold cross-validation)

**utils.py** defines useful functions like loading data from a csv file

**preprocessing.py** defines functions used for preprocessing data

**implementations.py** contains the required regression functions

**features.py** defines functions used for feature expansion

**train.py** defines functions used for training our model

**prediction.py** defines functions used for predicting labels and measuring accuracy

**generate_model.py** is a script that generates our model from scratch. It produces the following files: medians.npy, weights.npy, degrees.npy

**run.py** is a script that uses the files generated by generate_model.py and produces the predictions for the testing data. This is stored in the predictions.csv file

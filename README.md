## Project 1: [Higgs Boson](https://github.com/AntonRagot/ML_project/tree/master/project1)

Goal : Given a dataset from the [CERN](https://home.cern/), we had to determine wheter some observations correspond to the apparition of the Higgs Boson or not.

## Project 2: [Twitter sentiment analysis](https://github.com/AntonRagot/ML_project/tree/master/project2)

Goal : Given a dataset containing tweets, we had to determine wheter the tweet contains a positive smiley ( :) ) or negative ( :( ).
